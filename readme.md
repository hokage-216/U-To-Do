MERN-Stack
Web app built using MongoDB, ExpressJS, Node.js, and Reactjs (often called as MERN stack).

MongoDB, ExpressJS, Node.js, and Reactjs are used together to build web applications. In this, Node.js and Express bind together to serve the backend, MongoDB provides a NoSQL database to store the data and frontend is built using React that a user interacts with. All four of these technologies are open source, cross-platform and JavaScript based. Since they are JavaScript based, one of the main reasons why they are often used together.In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
